# CS7250 Project Proposal: 

## Project Pitch

### Title: AI Boom

**Story:**  We are investigating whether the massive capital investments flowing into AI companies are generating sustainable returns or fueling a speculative bubble. Using compelling 2D and 3D visualizations built with Observable, MapLibre, and possibly other platforms, we will illustrate the implications for developers and the broader economy through dynamic, interactive data storytelling.
